# net-juicer
<p>I created this because I wanted another BASH challenge, and because it's useful! 3-4 tools in one.</p>

## Dependencies: Python3

Debian/Ubuntu/PI:
```
sudo apt install python3
```
Fedora/DNF:
```
sudo dnf install python3
```
[Just go here â†—](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html)

## Running:
```
chmod +x net-juicer-*.sh
```
```
./net-juicer-slim.sh
```
```
./net-juicer-speed-test.sh 
```
Feel free to download/copy/modify, just let me know! I want to know what you do with it.
Also feel free to add to path and make it one of your regular Linux commands ;)

## I also have a wish list:

- [x] Speed Test (Heavy)
- [x] Netstat
- [x] IP/CIDR/Gateway/Hostname Info
- [x] ICMP Ping Test
- [ ] CDP/LLDP Implementation for switch ports
- [ ] Captive portal/web detection
- [ ] DNS info/resolution
